You know when you want to write something in one language and when you look up from the keyboard you find out you wrote it in another language?
That's when you go to [lang-switch](https://yardenshoham.github.io/lang-switch).

![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20454870/64967007-55a04300-d88f-11e9-9fbf-a5a4db87b408.gif)

## Usage

Enter the text you wrote into the "From" text box and get the text you intended to write in the "To" text box.

###### Built because a [friend](https://github.com/RonKatz1) keeps texting me without looking at the keyboard.
